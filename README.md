# Declaration for Applicable Regions

The [Vimium C](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium-c-all-by-keyboard/hfjbmagddngcpeloejdejnfgbamkjaeg)
    and other extensions published by [gdh1995](https://github.com/gdh1995)
    are available for all people in *"all regions"*
    of Chrome Web Store, Microsoft Edge Addons and some other markets.
This behavior is only to make these extensions easier to use, but<br>
**DOES NOT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED** the author (gdh1995) "agrees or has no objection to"
    that "Taiwan" can be parallel to "China",
    which was an **inappropriate** status quo in the stores' pages on 2019-11-16.

According to [The Constitution of the People's Republic of China](
    http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c505/201803/e87e5cd7c1ce46ef866f4ec8e2d709ea.shtml)
    and international consensus,
*Taiwan is **an inalienable part** of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China*.
