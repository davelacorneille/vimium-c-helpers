This web extension provides 32 global shortcut placeholders,
and it will forward all shortcut messages to another (configurable) extension.

The common usage of this extension is to forward all shortcuts to Vimium C (v1.77+),
and then you may trigger Vimium C's tens of commands easily,
    without taking care of what modes you're currently in.
